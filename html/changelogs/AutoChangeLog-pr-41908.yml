changes: 
  - code_imp: "Several minor updates to Assimilation."
  - balance: "Hosts no longer lose abilities if they fall below the required hive size."
  - balance: "Mind Control victims can no longer see nor hear for the duration of the control."
  - tweak: "Distortion Field now affects the victim and those surrounding them over time instead of instantly."
  - bugfix: "Abilities that inflict stamina damage now affect the head instead of spreading damage over the entire body."
  - tweak: "Mind Control now informs you of how long you have control for upon activation."
  - tweak: "Changed various do_mob for do_after. All hivemind abilities except for Mass Assimilation should now work in certain situations where they didn't before."
  - balance: "Abusing the sleep verb while mind controlling is no longer a viable tactic."
  - balance: "Assimilating/removing people into/from the hive now has screen-wide range, with time taken to assimilate increasing exponentially with distance. The time to assimilate from 4 tiles away is approximately the same. Assimilation's cooldown has also been increased by five seconds to compensate."
